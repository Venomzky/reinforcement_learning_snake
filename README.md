# reinforcement_learning_snake
First project in machine learning. Snake as an agent in totally new environment learns how to eat apples. Every entry in python dictionary contains vector between all segments of snake and apple and value for every move. Snake can go in every direction but is punished for going into wall or his own tail.

Amount of memory needed for snake to play is huge!
